Basic Tools For Sircles

I want the student to 
- Create A directory called `exam` in the home directory and has txt folder and mp3 folder and mp4 folder
- then `tail the last 7 lines` and `head` a file called `days.txt` containing numbers and weekdays to `tail.txt` and `head.txt` files inside the `/home/$USER/exam/txt` directory
- then `echo` the `$HOME` and `$PATH` to `/home/$USER/exam/txt/env.txt`
- then create and edit file called `/home/$USER/exam/txt/whoami.txt` that contain 
```
name: <XXXXX>
email: <XXXXXXXXX>
```
- then move all `.mp4` extentions to `/home/$USER/exam/mp4` directory and `.mp3` to `/home/$USER/exam/mp3` directory and delete all `.wav` and leave the `.jpg` files from `/home/$USER/random` directory
- then I want the student to see a file and take the API token `ansible-api-token=XXXXXXXXXXXX` and put it inside another file `/home/$USER/exam/txt/token.txt`
- I want student to create a groups named `devops` `testers`
- then I need student to create a user named `developer1` and `tester1`
- then I need student to create a `passwd` for the users and add `developer1` to `devops` and `tester1` to `testers` group the password is `sorint`
- then I want user to create a file called `/partage` and to be owned by user `tester1` and group `sorint` and to make a symbolic link to `/tmp/shared`
- I want the student to set an alias `alias ipa="ip --color a"` and make it persistent.
